# Machine Learning Statistics Assignment

1. Include a Jupyter notebook called scikit-learn.ipynb that contains the following.

- A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library
- Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. You may choose these yourself, based on what is covered in class or otherwise. Note that the demonstrations are at your discretion â€“ you may choose to have an overall spread of examples across the library or pick a particular part that you find interesting.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

2. Include a Jupyter notebook called scipy-stats.ipynb that contains the following.

- A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
- An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. You should find a data set on which it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensure the assumptions underlying ANOVA are met, and then perform and display the results of your ANOVA using scipy.stats.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.
