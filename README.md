### introduction

The brief for this assignment was to produce two jupyter notebooks giving an overview of both the scikit-learn and scipy-stats python libraries. Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms were required plus an example of a hypothesis test using ANOVA with scipy-stats. The notebooks were to include appropriate plots and other visualisations.

### contents of repositry
This repositry contains the 2 jupyter notebooks:
- scikit-learn.ipynb
- scipy-stats.ipynb
It also contains this README.md, a requirements.txt file listing all of the required python packages, plus a .gitignore file.

### installation

The jupyter notebooks require a python environment with all of the listed packages in the requirements.txt file installed. The easiest way to do this is with Anaconda which is available from here - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. 

<br>

### run

Once installed, or the appropriate python environment set up, you can run the jupyter notebooks directly from Terminal (or whatever command line interface you are using). First you need to download the notebook locally, navigate to that location on Terminal, and then open the jupyter app by typing `jupyter lab`. The app will open in a browser window but runs on your local machine. To start you should click on the `kernal` menu and select `Restart Kernal and Run All`.

### the notebooks

The scikit-learn begins with an overview of the package - its origins, uses, syntax, and a quick demonstration of the more basic features. I then introduce a dataset (wine) and use it to demononstrate a few more complex algorithims.
The scipy-stats notebook follows a similar pattern but, as per brief, focuses on a hypothesis test using ANOVA and the results.
The notebooks once opened in jupyter are completely interactive so feel free to change any of the parameters to see how it affects the outcomes.

### credits
A list of references can be found at the end of each notebook with further references credited throughout the notebooks. A very important resource not mentioned is the lectures throughout the course from Dr. Ian McLoughlin.
